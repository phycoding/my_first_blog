2. mp3_to_wav.py
MP3 to WAV Converter
====================

This is a Python script that converts MP3 files to WAV format using the PyDub library. It takes two arguments: the path to the folder containing the MP3 files, and the path to the folder where you want to save the resulting WAV files.

Requirements
------------

To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system, as well as the PyDub library. You can install PyDub using pip:

Copy

`pip install pydub`

Usage
-----

To use the script, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script. Then, run the script with the following command:

bashCopy

`python mp3_to_wav.py /path/to/mp3/files /path/to/output/folder`

Replace "/path/to/mp3/files" with the path to the folder containing your MP3 files, and "/path/to/output/folder" with the path to the folder where you want to save the resulting WAV files.

Output
------

The script will create a new WAV file for each MP3 file in the input folder, with the same name but a .wav extension. The resulting WAV files will be saved in the output folder you specified.

Limitations
-----------

This script only works with MP3 files and does not support other audio formats. Additionally, it does not modify or delete the original MP3 files.
